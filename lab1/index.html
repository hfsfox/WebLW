    <h1>The myth of the pier
    </h1>
    <h5>Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close together <br> like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his knees, his<br> body straght, his head erect; he was steadily watching a complicated<br> clock which indicated
        the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the days, the<br> months, and the years. At exactly half-past eleven Mr.Fogg would,<br> according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair to the Reform.<br><br> A rap at this moment sounded on the
        door of the cosy apartment where<br> Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant,<br> appeared.
        <br>
